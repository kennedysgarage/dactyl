# Dactyl (Jekyll)
Trying out a new starting point for websites that I build for clients. This is what I use when there is no need for CMS.

## Get Started
* run ```gem install jekyll```
* run ```bundle install```
* Start the local server ```jekyll serve --watch```

### Update your info
* ```_config.yml```
