# Dactyl (Jekyll)
Trying out a new starting point for websites that I build for clients. This is what I use when there is no need for CMS.

## Get Started
* run `gem install jekyll`
* run `bundle install`
* Start the local server `jekyll serve --watch`

### Docs
* [jekyll-assets](http://ixti.net/jekyll-assets/)
* Update your info `_config.yml`
