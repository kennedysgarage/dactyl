# Dactyl (PHP)
Trying out a new starting point for websites that I build for clients. This is what I use when there is no need for CMS.

# Docs
 * ```header.php``` Contains all of the repeatable HTML that belongs in the header
 * ```index.php``` Main page which calls in the header and footer
 * ```footer.php``` Contains all of the repeatable HTML that belongs in the footer
 * ```github.php``` This is used for GitHub's WebHook
 * ```editorconfig.txt``` Helps define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDE

## Credits
 * [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) is the base for the HTML & CSS on this project.
